-> randomly pick one out of the many statements. The case item expressions are positive integer values that represent the weights associated with each item. Probability of selecting an item is derived by the division of that item's weight divided by the sum of all weights.

-> The sum of all weights is 9, and hence the probability of taking the first branch is 1/9 or     11.11%, the probability of taking the second branch is 5/9 or 55.56% and the probability of taking the last branch is 3/9 or 33.33%.
