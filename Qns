1) Write a constraint if a is inside [0:1] b = 0, else 1;
2) Write a constraint if a[0:3] b = 0 | a[0:3] b = 0  | a[4:7] b = 1  | a[8:11] b = 2 | a[12:15] b = 3
3) Write a constraint such that is value of a is 1 then b is 3.
4) write a constraint to generate below pattern 5 -10 15 -20 25 -30   XXXX
5) Write a constraaint to generate the pattern 1122334455
6) Write a code to generate random number between 1.35 and 2.57
7) Write a constraint to generate the pattern 0102030405.
8) Write constraint to generate random values 25,27,30,36,40,45 without using "set membership".
9) Write a constraint to generate a random even number between 50 and 100.
10) Write a for a 32 bit rand variable such that it should have 12 number of 1's non consecutively.
11) Write a constraint to genarate FACTORIAL of first 5 even numbers and odd numbers . 
12) Write a constraint such that even locations contains odd numbers and odd locations contains even numbers.
13) Write a SystemVerilog program to randomize a 32-bit variable, but only randomize the 12th bit.
14) Write a constraint on two dimensional array for generating even numbers in the first 4 locations and odd numbers 
    in the next 4 locations.Also the even number should be in multiple of 4 and odd number should be multiple of 3.
